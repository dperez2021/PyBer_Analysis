# PyBer Analysis Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize PyBer 2019 ride-sharing data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, to help the company improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. V. Isualize has given this project to Omar and I in which we will create multiple graphs and data sheets that show the following:

    1. The percentage of total rides,
    2. The percentage of total drivers,
    3. The percentage of total fares,
    4. The average fare per ride and driver,
    5. The total fare by city type.

## Resources
    -Software: Python 3.7.7, Anaconda Navigator, Conda, Jupyter Notebook
    -Python Libraries: Pandas & Matplotlib
    -Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

## Results

In the PyBer Summary Data Fram we find the largest demand for PyBer among riders in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. During the months of Data we analyzed the amount of riders in urban was 1625 or 68.4%, suburban 625 or 26.3%, and rural 125 just 5.3% of riders. Reference to the figure below display how rdies in Urban cities contributed to the most during the five month period.

When you analyze the amount of drivers on PyBer you see a consistent pattern where urban accounts for 2405 drivers or 80.9%, suburban 490 drivers 16.5%, and rural 78 drivers just 2.6%.

Given the amount of drivers on PyBer and the amount of rides recorded during the five month time period of this data we now take a look at the total fares by city type. Pyber transactions in urban cities totaled $39,854.38 or 62.7% of total fares, suburban $19,356.33 or 30.5%, and rural $4,327.93 just 6.8% of all total fares. The majority of the revenues were generated from urban cities.

When we analyze the PyBer data from a cost perspective there are average fare per ride and average fare per driver. In the rural cities there is a $10 gap on fares per ride from urban cities. The average fare per ride in rural is $34.62, suburban is $30.97, and urban is $24.53. When you look at this in perspective from average fare per driver the gap between rural and urban is nearly $40. The average fare per driver in rural is $55.49, suburban is $39.50, and urban is $16.57. This shows that althought riders in rural cities seem to pay the most about 10% more than in suburban cities the gain on drivers is almost 20% from that of suburban cities average fare per driver.

The mulitple-line chart "Total Fare by City Type" further supports the PyBer Summary DataFrame by providing trends of total fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities during the five month period. This chart shows a trend in peak times which shows end of February and spikes in "Spring Break" which usually happens during the end of March and beginning of April.

## Summary

Some recommendations I would provide the CEO of PyBer for addressing the disparities among the city types would be to increase the cost of rides in rural cities so and lower cost of urban cities ride fares. If this is done the ratio can be similar to the average fare per driver which has a large disparity. If this option isn't something the CEO is interested in then analyzing the travel distance would help determine what is the true cost by mileage so we can better determine profitibaility in city types. Lastly looking into peak season to provide more drivers in urban cities to take advantage of the high demand would help profitability. The solution could be transferring suburban city drivers to urban city drivers during spring break to assist with the peak that urban city face.
